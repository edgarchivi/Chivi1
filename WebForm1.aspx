        Bootstrapping or booting refers to a group of metaphors which refer to a self-sustaining process that proceeds without external help.
The phrase appears to have originated in the early 19th century United States (particularly in the sense "pull oneself over a fence by one's bootstraps"), to mean an absurdly impossible action, an adynaton.[1][2][3]
Dr. Douglas Engelbart used the term centrally in his work from 1970 to 2010,[4] referring to the process used by lumberjacks to hoist themselves up trees (to cut higher branches) using a strap wrapped around the tree. He founded an institute "The Bootstrap Alliance",[5] focused on "getting better at getting better" embodying the notion of the Bootstrap Circuit, taking in feedback from the output and feeding it back in to improve.
